Windy, with severe gales and possible storm force winds in the far north at first. Mild in the south at first, otherwise rather cold with overnight frost. Another bout of wet and windy weather is likely to spread eastwards across the UK early next week. Thereafter, the weather will alternate between spells of wet and windy weather, and colder, brighter, more showery interludes. Often windy, with gales in places, the risk of severe gales in exposed areas. Temperatures will vary, often above average in unsettled spells, and generally below normal with the clearer conditions.", "title": "UK Outlook for Saturday 10 Jan 2015 to Monday 19 Jan 2015:"}, "id": "day6to15"}, {"Paragraph": {"$": "The most likely scenario is for conditions through the latter part of January onwards into early February to remain unsettled and often windy with periods of milder but dull and wet weather, interspersed by brief clearer but colder and showery spells with frosty nights.
